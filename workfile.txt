Hey,Looking at your latest post i can see that the pictures don't have a path to the picture file. Fox example the first in your latest post links to [email redacted] which is not a valid path to a picture. That's why the picture is not showing up.Looking at an older post, OOTD #11: Black &White Smiles, the link to the picture is correct: https://inthelifewithayo.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/img_3450-0.jpg this is why your photo is showing up.

Hello. I'm working with the Sela theme and having trouble with the front page/homepage. When I set a featured image for a wide screen look, I get a white box on top of the image and I don't know how to remove it. Can someone help? Here's the code:<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://kristinoberlander.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/home.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-59" src="https://kristinoberlander.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/home.jpg" alt="2509 x 1673" width="620" height="413" /></a></p>

Hello!While I do not see a white box I do see white spacing at the top. If you have Custom Design as part of the Premium package you can close the white at the top of the image with the following CSS code placed in your customizer:
Note also that featured images for the Sela Theme need to be the following:The featured image on the front page and on pages works best with images at least 1180 wide.
Featured Images for posts should be at least 820 wide by 312.You must log in to post.

Hello,I have created a page called "N&R News" so my company can frequently publish updates as this is the only section that will probably get updated frequently for SEO purposes. I have a couple of questions:- I'd like to set a featured image for this page to resemble all other pages in the main nav, but it's not working right
- The Facebook is properly linking, but not the LinkedIn, and I've tried troubleshooting this, and don't know what to do
- The title of the post I've published is showing up as a link to a page that has the exact same content, and I want to get rid of that.
- I'd like some aesthetics changed - no author, a red font to match the other titles within the site, etc.If someone could help me out, that would be great!!!!!!!

When you say things like "- The title of the post I've published is showing up as a link to a page that has the exact same content, and I want to get rid of that." you need to give us the URL of the post and page, starting with http.When you ask about custom design changes, do you have the Custom Design upgrade?

You do not need static pages. You just need category pages and Posts. Make more posts and the structure will become visible. It takes several posts for themes to really take shape.

Mar 9, 2015, 9:58 PM

I'm only asking about a specific part of the site, not the whole thing. I understand that all static pages are "posts" and I know what my goal is. I want to use this page or "post" as a press release tool for my company. I know that I will continue populating it as time progresses, but I just want minor things fixed that I mentioned above.

I am saying this in a kindly way. lol :D Neither raincoaster nor I share "sentiments" in support threads. We post correct answers to support questions and have been doing that longer than all but one support staff member has even been on staff.There are many misunderstandings and misconceptions when it comes to custom menus. I suggest you read these two posts I link to below.
http://wpbtips.wordpress.com/2010/06/30/posts-on-pages/
http://wpbtips.wordpress.com/2011/12/19/custom-menus/You have created static pages that will never automatically update. Technically you can't post to more than one page on any blog but do read on. Static Pages and dynamic Category Pages are not the same. The former cannot automatically update but the latter do.
http://en.support.wordpress.com/pages/
http://en.support.wordpress.com/category-pages/If you want to have pages that do update then they must be replaced by dynamic category pages (and sub-category pages) that will automatically update every time you publish a post assigned to the relevant category and/or sub-category.By default the front page of the blog is the post that displays all posts in your blog. Though there is only one dynamic page in a blog for posts (not pages) http://en.support.wordpress.com/post-vs-page/ and we cannot post to more than that one page, we can create the appearance that we have posted to more than one page.We organize posts by assigning categories to them. You can create a custom menu and add the dynamic categories and sub-categories pages into the custom menu, and order them as you wish.

I apologize if I offended you. I was actually speaking of a few different people I spoke to earlier today. I will admit, I am frustrated with myself because I have been trying to figure this out for quite some time now.Originally, I wanted to have an excerpt of each post on the homepage. Someone from Support earlier told me it wouldn't be ideal because of my theme's limitations. She then told me that a new page (static page, I'm guessing?) would be ideal and that it could be added in the main nav. I went ahead and did that and assumed that I could go ahead and add posts right on that page. Maybe that's where I confused things.

Good to hear :)Okay, so after reading. I think my first step is to set up a category page and trash the page that I created. Is that correct? I only want one page to update frequently, and it's that one. Because of that, I'm not sure that I need a custom menu. Or am I totally wrong?
raincoaster

Mar 9, 2015, 11:03 PM

The first link I gave you contains links to the most important things you need to read, and you need to read them in order. It will all make sense once you have a dozen or so posts in various categories and have tinkered with menus a bit.

I've read. I created a category called N&R News. I also read about the custom menu...but I'm still not sure why I need that. I don't intend for these posts to populate on the homepage or on a dropdown. I have added my post to my category though.

I don't know what Quickinstall is, but it doesn't look like you have a blog at WordPress.com. What is your web host? It looks like Godaddy, in which case you need to deal with them and get support from the WordPress.ORG forums.
